One of the highlights of the [Gazebo 4.0.0](http://gazebosim.org/blog/gazebo4) release is the added support for the trending VR platform: Oculus-Rift. Oculus-Rift Gazebo Navigator is a simple tool that exploits the capabilities of the simulation environment's physics-engine to provide you with the ultimate virtual-reality experience in Gazebo. So simulation will no longer be just a part of development, but instead act as a new medium to demostrate your product to your clients in its work environment (in full-scale).
